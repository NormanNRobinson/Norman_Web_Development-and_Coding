    The Master Plan represents a collective expression of ambitions and commitments of the University of Yangon community, supported by dedicated partners,
    <br>regarding its revitalization in the following ways:
    <ol>
        <li>Myanmar Flagship University: Vision, Mission and Foundational Principles: UY is set to modernize and expand its vision and mission, and bring up to date
            <br>its foundational principles which will orient all its activities and future development. The University will develop as an autonomous Flagship University in
            <br>the arts, sciences, and technology, with the long-term goal of becoming a more comprehensive institution with a strong internal capacity to deliver
            <br>advanced teaching, learning, research and service to the nation. The University will promote effective intellectual, programmatic and organizational
            <br>linkages with other universities in Yangon and Myanmar, and active international partnerships.
            
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Efficient University Governance and Organization: UY strives to emerge as the first autonomous university in Myanmar. As part of the implementation of <br>
            the Master Plan, it will progressively develop and put in practice a system of governance supported by solid structures and professional capacity in the <br>
            areas of academic affairs, organization, staffing and financial administration. Autonomous operations are governed by the goals of quality, integrity, <br>
            responsibility, relevance and efficiency. UY will serve as a model for other universities in Myanmar to emulate in progressively developing institutional <br>
            autonomy and efficient governance and organization.</li><br>
            <li>
            Attracting the Best Talent and Building a Vibrant Student Body: In keeping with its history and renewed mission, UY will once again become a place <br>
            where outstanding talent is attracted and cultivated, and where gifted and ambitious learners from all walks of life, representing the rich diversity of the <br>
            country, are supported to achieve their full potential to become inspiring, efficient and responsible professionals and leaders of their communities and of <br>
            the nation, and proudly and competently represent Myanmar in the global community.</li><br>
            <li>
            Excellence and Relevance in Curriculum, Teaching and Learning: Responding to the needs of modern society, the advancement of knowledge and the <br>
            goals of national development, UY sets out to revamp its programs of study, continuously revise and modernize the curricula and transform the <br>
            pedagogy to achieve excellence and relevance in teaching, learning and development of skills, competences and values that are relevant to students as <br>
            professionals, citizens and leaders, and build the foundations for life-long learning.</li><br>
            <li>
            Excellence and Relevance in Research: UY strives to become a university that successfully combines its teaching and learning and research missions, <br>
            with research as an integral and significant part of its academic activities. The University shall stimulate and support innovative, cross-disciplinary <br>
            research initiatives and projects – including from an applied perspective – and facilitate active engagement of students and academic staff with <br>
            international peers, leading scholars and centers of knowledge to be able to embrace the needs of the Knowledge Age realistically and contribute <br>
            effectively to the fulfillment of national development goals.</li><br>
            <li>
            Academic Infrastructure and Technology in Support of Education and Research: UY strives to ensure up-to-date academic technology support for its <br>
            members. It shall provide its students and academics with regular, user-friendly and secure access to information and communication technologies, <br>
            research instruments and on-line resources and tools necessary for high quality teaching, learning, research and collaboration within and outside the <br>
            university campus and internationally.</li><br>
            <li>
            Revitalization of Campus and Services: UY embarks on an ambitious and carefully designed program of integrated campus redevelopment which will <br>
            make the best use of the existing land and facilities, preserve and revitalize its iconic buildings and bring new, efficient and environmentally conscious <br>
            developments that will meet the needs of teaching, learning and research in the modern age. Creating an inclusive physical environment that <br>
            stimulates innovative teaching and collaborative learning will be a top priority in the campus revitalization. The upgraded campus facilities will provide <br>
            an efficient home for university growth, a safe, welcoming and vibrant environment for academic, professional and personal development of its <br>
            members, and inspire and facilitate closer interaction with the community.</li><br>
            <li>
            Internal Institutional Strategic Planning and External Partnerships: As it develops progressively as an autonomous university and embraces greater <br>
            responsibility for its revitalization and development, UY shall lay the foundations of professional strategic planning of its academic, institutional and <br>
            physical growth, inclusive of all stakeholders, on a sustained basis and in cooperation with the most relevant and committed partners within Myanmar <br>
            and internationally. UY shall use this Master Plan as a stepping stone towards building an efficient and transparent internal planning process for defining <br>
            and achieving its long-term goals and ambitions. Like all efficient universities in the world, the University of Yangon commits to running its operations <br>
            based on clear internal strategic planning, while also cultivating beneficial external partnerships.</li><br>
            <li>
            Active Public Presence and Visibility Locally and Internationally: Rebuilding Myanmar’s Flagship University and reclaiming its status of a leading <br>
            university in the nation and in the region, and striving for excellence and recognition in the international academia, UY is actively strengthening its <br>
            visibility and proactive presence domestically and globally. Over the coming years, the University shall invest its resources and efforts in developing and <br>
            implementing comprehensive strategies for engagement with a wide array of relevant domestic and international partners that will systematically <br>
            reflect and enhance its core academic priorities, and help transform UY into a university firmly embedded in the community and with a distinct <br>
            international character.</li><br>
            In addition to providing a broad vision for transforming the University of Yangon into a Flagship University by 2030, the Master Plan further focuses on four <br>
