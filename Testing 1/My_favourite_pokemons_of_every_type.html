    <h1><b>My Favourite Pokemons of every type</b></h1>
    <p><h2>Normal Type- Grafaiai</h2></p>
    <p> This normal/poison type pokemon is from the generation 9 in the region paldea. It is based on the Aye-aye.<br>
    It uses it's drool to draw. Grafaiai is the evolved form of shroodle. Since I like painting and drawing, Grafaiai draw attention to my eye<br>
    since it's debut. It's a fun pokemon that likes to draw graffiti. I like punk music and drawing graffiti on the walls like what teens do<br>
    in the 90's and early 2000 so the pokemon fits with all my hobbies.</p>
